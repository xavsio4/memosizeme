    With no footwear, stand with your back to a wall, but with your butt a few
    inches away from the wall. Use a hardcover book about 1" thick or similar.
    Place it between your legs, spine up, and push it back to the wall to create
    a right angle. Pull it firmly up into your groin so that you feel firm
    pressure on your perineum (soft tissue) Ensure the book is square to the
    wall i.e the spine is horizontal to the ground and the edge of the book is
    flush against the wallHave your partner mark the wall at the top of the book
    spine. Step away and measure from the wall to this mark.<br />
    <br />NORMAL RANGE<br />Inseam measures for a bike size are not the same as
    inseam measures for clothing. A 32" pants inseam does not translate to an
    inseam for bike sizing. As a general guideline, common ranges are:<br />
    <br />HEIGHT INSEAM<br />5'0" - 5'6" 72 - 82cm<br />5'6" - 5'9" 80 - 85
    cm<br />5'9 - 6' 83 - 90 cm<br />Over 6' 88 - 94cm
