    Hold your arm straight out to the side, palm down, and clench a pencil or
    similar stick in your fist. Do not try to extend or stretch your arm out.
    Your arm should be plugged into your shoulder socket without hunching up
    your shoulder. i.e a neutral position. Measure from the side of the rib cage
    to the body side of the pencil. Measure both arms. The difference is
    typically within 0 - 2 cm. Use the average of both.<br /><br />NORMAL
    RANGE<br />Average woman: arm length is comparable to torso length e.g 52 -
    56cm. If you are a tall woman, or know you have long arms, expect arm length
    to be 2 - 6 cm longer than your torso.<br /><br />Average men: arm length is
    = torso length (e.g. 55 - 65cm), or up to 6 cm longer than their torso.
    People with a significant "ape factor" may have arms 6 - 10cm longer than
    their torso length.
