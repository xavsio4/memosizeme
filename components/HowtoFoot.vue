    In bare or socked feet, stand up straight with your heels backed against a
    wall, and your feet together and parallel. <br />
    <br />
    Use a straight edge pulled into touch the end of your toes and parallel to
    the wall to mark the distance of the longest toes. Step aside and measure
    from the wall to the mark and record. This is your foot length.
