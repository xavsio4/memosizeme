    Have a partner stand behind you and locate the acromion process on the back
    and towards the end of each shoulder. Use a flexible tape to measure the
    distance across your back from between these points. Follow the curve of
    your body instead of trying to estimate a direct line. Record. This is your
    shoulder width. Shoulder width is used to recommend a suitable handlebar
    width for road bikes..
